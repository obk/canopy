# canopy

A small, read-only web viewer for git repositories, in the spirit of cgit,
with a sourcehut-style look. One Go binary with its templates and CSS
embedded. Pages need no JavaScript.

It is meant for a personal git server: you push over SSH, and everyone else
can browse and clone over HTTPS. It is not a forge: there are no accounts,
issues or pull requests.

- **Browse:** an index of every repository (grouped by folder), summaries
  with the README and the license, trees with syntax highlighting, rendered markdown, raw
  files, blame, history with a commit graph, commits with diffs and
  `.diff` and `.patch` downloads, comparisons between any two refs, refs
  with how far each branch is from the default one, tags with their
  release notes, and tarballs and zips. Links can select lines of a file.
- **Clone** anything over HTTPS (`git clone https://git.example.com/NAME`).
  Pushing over HTTP is never possible.
- **Push** over SSH to a locked-down `git` account. Pushing to a name that
  doesn't exist yet creates the repository.
- **Deploy** with one command from your own machine:
  `./install.sh root@your-server` sets up canopy, HTTPS, bot protection,
  pushing and a hardened server, and can put SSH on a private
  [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) network so that only the web site is
  public.

## Documentation

| File | What's in it |
|---|---|
| [usage.md](usage.md) | Day to day: cloning, pushing, pulling, new repositories, a short SSH name for the server |
| [deploy.md](deploy.md) | Putting it on a server, from a fresh VPS to a hardened setup with backups |
| [security.md](security.md) | How the server is protected, layer by layer |
| [config/README.md](config/README.md) | Every setting in `config/canopy.toml` |
| [customisation.md](customisation.md) | Themes, your own colours and fonts, step by step |
| [development.md](development.md) | Running and testing it on your own machine, including Windows |

## Try it locally

    go run ./demo                        # sample repositories in demo/repos
    go run . -config demo/canopy.toml   # http://127.0.0.1:8080

Both work on Linux, macOS and Windows; the demo needs only Go and git.

The demo has a C project with releases, merges and branches, a
`.dotfiles` repository with symlinks, markdown notes with images, a nested
repository, an empty one, and one hidden by the config.

To serve your own folder of repositories:

    go build
    ./canopy -root ~/src -listen 127.0.0.1:8080

## Deploying

From the canopy folder on your machine (needs Go and SSH access to the
server):

    ./install.sh root@git.example.com

It asks a few questions; the defaults are the most secure choices. It then
builds canopy for the server, uploads it and installs:

    internet --> Caddy :443 (HTTPS) --> Anubis (bot check) --> canopy 127.0.0.1:8080
    you      --> SSH (over Tailscale) --> git account (git-shell) --> /srv/git

Before finishing it checks that a fresh SSH login and pushing still work,
and undoes the SSH changes if they don't. Later, `./install.sh … --yes`
re-deploys with the same answers. [deploy.md](deploy.md) walks through
the whole thing, including running the installer on the server by hand.

Tested on Debian 13, Ubuntu 24.04 and 26.04, and Fedora 44.

### Who can reach what

| | No hardening | `--harden` | `--harden --tailscale` |
|---|---|---|---|
| Web site and `git clone` over HTTPS (80, 443) | Internet | Internet | Internet |
| Push over HTTP | Never | Never | Never |
| Push over SSH (`git` account) | Internet, push keys only | Internet, push keys only | **Tailnet only**, push keys only |
| Admin SSH logins | Internet, the system's own sshd settings | Internet, keys only, listed accounts only | **Tailnet only**, keys only, listed accounts only |
| Root over SSH | The system's own setting | Never with a password; never at all with an admin account | Same, and tailnet only |
| Other ports | The firewall is left as it is | Blocked | Blocked from the internet |
| canopy and Anubis | This machine only | This machine only | This machine only |

[security.md](security.md) explains each of these.

## Configuration

Everything is in [`config/canopy.toml`](config/canopy.toml):

- `listen`, `root` (the folder of repositories), `depth`, `title`,
  `description`, `about` (a markdown page for an **about** tab), `favicon`
- `owner`: who the top-level repositories belong to, and `owner_url`:
  their website, linked from the footer ("served by you")
- `[clone] http`: the base URL shown in clone commands
- `[activity]`: an **activity** tab with a year of commits as a
  GitHub-style graph (off unless `enabled = true`; mirrors never count)
- `[signatures]`: SSH keys whose signed commits and tags get a
  **verified** badge (off unless a key is listed)
- `[theme]`: a colour theme for light and dark mode (GitHub, Ayu,
  Night Owl / Light Owl, Catppuccin, or your own under `[themes]`), and
  Google Fonts for text and code (downloaded and served by canopy, so
  visitors never contact Google)
- `[repos."name"]`: a repository's `description`, `homepage`, or
  `hidden = true` (or, without touching the config, `ssh git@HOST private
  NAME on`)

`./canopy -check` validates the file and prints the resulting settings.
Unknown keys are errors, so typos don't go unnoticed.
[config/README.md](config/README.md) describes every setting.

Repositories are found under `root`, up to `depth` folders deep: bare
repositories (`foo.git`) and work trees (`foo/.git`). The folder path is the
URL, so `/srv/git/tools/foo.git` is served at `/tools/foo` and listed under
**tools** on the index. A repository's `description` file is its
description. Dot-named folders are only served when they are bare
repositories (`.dotfiles.git`), so a version-controlled `~/.ssh` never is.

## URLs

Modelled on sourcehut. The `item` separator lets branch names contain
slashes.

    /activity?year={year}&page={n}       commit graph and activity, last year by default ([activity] in the config)
    /about                               the about page (about in the config)
    /{repo}                              summary: recent commits, license, refs, clone URL, README
    /{repo}/tree/{ref}/item/{path}       folder listing or highlighted file
    /{repo}/blob/{ref}/item/{path}       raw file
    /{repo}/blame/{ref}/item/{path}      blame
    /{repo}/log/{ref}/item/{path}        history, paginated, with a commit graph for the whole repository
    /{repo}/commit/{hash}                commit with diff (.diff for a plain diff, .patch for a mailbox patch)
    /{repo}/compare/{from}...{to}        the commits {to} has that {from} lacks, and their changes (.diff, .patch)
    /{repo}/compare                      a form for picking two refs to compare
    /{repo}/refs                         branches, each with how far it is from the default branch, and tags (paginated)
    /{repo}/tag/{name}                   a tag: its message (release notes), signature, commit, archives and the changes since the tag before
    /{repo}/log.atom                     Atom feed of the newest commits
    /{repo}/tags.atom                    Atom feed of the newest tags
    /{repo}/archive/{ref}.tar.gz         tarball (.zip for a zip)

On tree and blame pages, `?lines=12` or `?lines=12-20` highlights lines;
clicking a line number selects it, and clicking another extends the
selection to there.

Pages carry an ETag, so a browser or feed reader asking again gets a short
"not modified" until something is pushed. Raw files, diffs, patches and
archives stay cached until what they hold changes.

How far each branch is from the default one ("2 ahead, 5 behind main")
needs git 2.41 or later on the server; with an older git the refs page
leaves the counts out.

`git clone https://host/{repo}` uses git's smart HTTP protocol, fetch only.

## Source layout

    main.go              flags, -check, HTTP server
    internal/config      TOML loading (unknown keys are errors)
    internal/fonts       downloads [theme] fonts from Google Fonts and caches them
    internal/theme       built-in colour themes and highlighting styles, [themes] checks
    internal/git         runs the git binary: log, tree, blob, diff, blame, refs, archive
    internal/render      syntax highlighting, markdown rendering and sanitizing
    internal/sigcheck    checks SSH signatures on commits and tags, for [signatures]
    internal/server      routing, handlers, templates and CSS (embedded)
    config/              your settings, about page and icon
    demo/                sample repositories and their config
    install.sh           installer and remote deploy (also writes canopy-update)
    update.sh            quick redeploy of canopy and config/ only (or CANOPY_CONFIG_DIR)

Development: `go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `gofmt -l .`,
`shellcheck install.sh update.sh` and `govulncheck ./...` must all be
clean. See [development.md](development.md) for running and testing it
locally.

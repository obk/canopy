#     ./update.sh                  # the server install.sh last deployed to
#     ./update.sh USER@HOST
#     ./update.sh --force          # overwrite config edited on the server
#
# If the config on the server was changed since it was last uploaded (someone
# edited /etc/canopy there), nothing is changed: update.sh shows how server
# and local differ, and --force uploads yours over it.
#
# Use install.sh instead for changes that go beyond canopy and its config:
# push keys, the domain, Anubis, hardening, or the first [mirrors] entry.

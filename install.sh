#   On your own machine, aimed at a server over SSH. It asks a few questions,
#   builds canopy for the server, uploads it and runs the install there:
#
#     ./install.sh root@git.example.com
#
#   On the server itself, with flags instead of questions.
#
# Settings come from config/canopy.toml (see config/README.md). Edit it,
# build, then run as root:
#
#     go build
#     sudo ./install.sh --domain git.example.com --anubis
#
# --push-key sets up pushing over SSH, and --harden locks the server down
# (firewall, key-only SSH, automatic security updates). --tailscale moves SSH
# (logins and pushes) onto a tailnet, leaving only the web site public.
#
# Run with --help for all options. Re-running upgrades in place and applies
# any changes made to config/canopy.toml.

Usage: ./install.sh USER@HOST [options]    deploy to a server over SSH
       sudo ./install.sh [options]        install on this machine

With USER@HOST (or an ssh config alias, or ssh://USER@HOST:PORT), it runs on
your own machine: asks for the domain and the other choices below (flags
given on the command line answer them), builds canopy for the server,
uploads it with config/ and runs the install there over SSH. Answers are
saved in config/deploy.env and offered as defaults the next time. To keep
a server's config folder elsewhere (its own repository, say), set
CANOPY_CONFIG_DIR to it.

  -y, --yes            take the saved or default answers without asking

Installs canopy as a systemd service, optionally behind Caddy and Anubis.
Site settings (repository folder, title, ...) come from the config file;
see config/README.md.

  --config FILE        config to install (default: config/canopy.toml)
  --domain HOST        public hostname; sets up Caddy with automatic HTTPS
  --email ADDR         email for Let's Encrypt notices (optional)
  --no-caddy           don't set up Caddy even though --domain is given
  --anubis             put Anubis in front of canopy (needs Caddy)
  --challenge KIND     Anubis challenge for browsers:
                         nojs  meta-refresh, no JavaScript needed (default)
                         pow   JavaScript proof-of-work, stronger
  --binary FILE        canopy binary to install (default: ./canopy)
  --self-update        install canopy-update, a root-only command that builds
                       the newest canopy release on the server and switches
                       to it (sudo canopy-update); installs Go $GO_VERSION
  --update-from URL    where canopy-update gets releases (https only, tags
                       signed with RELEASE_KEY in install.sh; default:
                       $UPDATE_FROM)

Pushing over SSH:
  --push-key FILE      allow pushes from the public key(s) in FILE; may be
                       repeated. Creates a '$GIT_USER' user that can only run
                       git (git-shell). Replaces the previously allowed keys.
                       Pushing to a repository that doesn't exist yet
                       creates it.
  --github-keys USER   also allow pushes from the SSH keys USER has on GitHub
                       (https://github.com/USER.keys); may be repeated. The
                       keys are fetched on every run, from the account the
                       name belonged to the first time, even once renamed
                       (kept by its ID in $GH_IDS)
  --github-sync        keep the keys from GitHub (--github-keys and
                       --admin-github) in sync: the server fetches them
                       again every 15 minutes, so a key added to or removed
                       from GitHub counts without running this again
  --deny-force-push    refuse pushes that rewrite or delete branches
  --manage-repos       let push keys rename and delete repositories
                       (ssh $GIT_USER@HOST rename / delete). Off by default:
                       with it, a stolen push key can erase a repository.

Server hardening:
  --harden             firewall that only lets in SSH and the web site,
                       key-only SSH limited to accounts that have keys,
                       automatic security updates, Caddy admin API locked
                       to a root-only socket, and a report of anything else
                       that is listening
  --ssh-allow USER     with --harden: also let USER log in over SSH; may be
                       repeated. The first --harden run allows the accounts
                       that have SSH keys at that point; later runs keep
                       that list and only add accounts named here.
  --tailscale          with --harden: join a tailnet and accept SSH (logins
                       and pushes) only from it; the firewall leaves only
                       the web site open to the internet
  --tailscale-key FILE auth key (tskey-auth-...) to join the tailnet with;
                       needed only while this server isn't in one
  --no-tailscale       keep SSH open to the internet (when deploying, this
                       answers the Tailscale question with no)
  --admin-user NAME    an admin account to log in as instead of root: created
                       if missing, in the sudo group, with the SSH keys of
                       whoever runs this (or --admin-key). With --harden,
                       root logins over SSH are turned off once that
                       account has a key and a password.
  --admin-key FILE     public key(s) for a new --admin-user
  --admin-github USER  also let the SSH keys USER has on GitHub log in as
                       --admin-user (sudo still asks for its password)
  --admin-password-hash FILE
                       crypt hash (openssl passwd -6) to set as the new
                       --admin-user's password, which sudo asks for
  --undo-ssh-hardening remove the SSH hardening and open SSH in the firewall
                       again (the way back in after a lockout)

  --uninstall          remove what this script installed (keeps
                       repositories, $CONFIG and $STATE)
  --dry-run            print what would be done without changing anything
  -h, --help           show this help

  ./install.sh root@git.example.com            # asks, then deploys over SSH
